My project is to create a website for aa fictional dance studio named Konfluenze Dance Studio.

KONFLUENZE DANCE STUDIO
Established in 2005, Konfluenze Dance Studio originated from a close-knit group of friends who shared a profound passion for street dance and its vibrant culture. We recognized the dearth of a robust street dance scene in Singapore during those early years. Undeterred, we seized every opportunity that came our way and, through battles, competitions, and showcases, evolved into a stronger and more expansive community.

The Konfluenze website serves as a dynamic platform, offering opportunities for both dancers and non-dancers alike. It is a safe space where individuals can pursue their dreams or simply revel in the joy of dance. We take pride in providing a diverse range of dance classes encompassing various genres. Each instructor is recognized for their expertise in a specific genre, ensuring a rich and authentic learning experience.

At Konfluenze, we believe in the power of diversity and the fusion of experiences. Our team includes foreign, experienced, and older generation instructors such as Mr. Wiggles and Greenteck, who bring a wealth of knowledge and authenticity to our studio. Through their guidance, students have the opportunity to delve deep into the true essence of street dance.

Whether you are looking to learn, improve, or simply have fun, Konfluenze invites you to join our community. Together, we strive to cultivate and support the vibrant street dance culture in Singapore.


# DESIGN PROCESS
The primary objective of our website is to extend dance classes to all. Our mission is to broaden the exposure of street dance culture and actively contribute to its flourishing community. At Konfluenze, we welcome individuals of all ages who are keen on exploring the world of dance, creating an inclusive space for anyone with a passion for movement.

Recognizing the lack of recognition for street dance within Singapore, our website has been strategically designed to bridge this gap. We have incorporated various dance-related elements, including captivating images from past events. These visual representations serve as a testament to our commitment, showcasing the energy, skill, and vibrancy that define the street dance culture. By providing a glimpse into our dynamic and engaging activities, we aim to instill trust, faith, and ultimately gain the recognition of the wider community.

Through these efforts, we aspire to not only impart dance skills but also foster a sense of community and appreciation for street dance. Konfluenze stands as a welcoming hub where individuals of diverse backgrounds can come together, learn, and contribute to the ever-evolving tapestry of street dance in Singapore. Join us on this exciting journey of discovery, expression, and collective growth.
